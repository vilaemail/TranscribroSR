# TranscribroSR

TranscribroSR is a fork of [Transcribro](https://github.com/soupslurpr/Transcribro).

TranscribroSR is a private and on-device speech recognition keyboard and service for Android.\
It uses whisper.cpp to run the OpenAI Whisper family of models and Silero VAD for voice activity detection.\
It features a voice input keyboard, enabling you to type with speech.\
It can also be used by other apps either explicitly or when set as the user-selected speech to text app which some apps
may use for speech to text.

## Language support

TranscribroSR currently only supports Serbian. Once supporting other languages is [implemented](https://github.com/soupslurpr/Transcribro/issues/18) in [upstream](https://github.com/soupslurpr/Transcribro) there will no longer be need for this fork.
